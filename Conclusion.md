## 1. Intro
American Sign Language (ASL) is a complex language used in majority by the d/Deaf community. ASL does not directly translate to English and requires skilled, certified interpreters to accurately translate to and from spoken language. For the d/Deaf community, interpreters are expensive and scarce. Creating software to interpret when a human interpreter isn't available could help bridge the gap between the deaf and hearing world. To begin such a software is a huge feat, especially for one person. Creating a model that can identify ASL fingerspelling handshapes is a reasonable goal.

## 2. What was learned
Python is a huge asset when it comes to machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV). Learning some basic Python is easy if you have some coding background. However, the libraries used for ML and CV are typically the part you have to actually learn. I spent half of my time diving into Python libraries that would be needed for this project.

Understanding ML and CV is equally important when working on a CV project. I read about many different types of ML: linear regression, logistic regression, k means clustering, k-nearest neighbors, neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and random forests. My goal was to understand how things where being "seen" by the computer. Based on different learned features, the computer can categorize and sort objects accurately with varying accuracy. By looking at what these different algorithms can do, decisions can be made about which model handels specific data the best. CV uses ML to take image data and identify or categorize them in different ways. For example, using CV you can identify whether a specific item is in the field of view or identify which type of item is in the field of view. Of course there are many more applications of CV, but in brief this is what it's used for. About one third of my time was used to learn about ML and CV.



## 3. Obstacles
- Not enough Data!!!
- Needing to learn everything before being able to start
- Having limited access to finished projects
